# Building Real-World Systems as a CSE Undergrad

Being a Computer Science undergraduate at IIITDM Jabalpur, I quickly realized that **writing code that runs** and **building systems that scale** are two very different things.

This blog marks the beginning of documenting that journey — from learning fundamentals to building production-grade systems in **AI, backend engineering, and Web3**.

## Where It Started

Like most students, I began with:
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Web development basics  
- Small academic projects  

But very early on, I felt something was missing.

I didn’t just want my code to pass test cases —  
I wanted it to **solve real problems**, handle failures, and work under real constraints.

## Learning by Building (and Breaking)

Everything changed when I started building **end-to-end projects**:

- **TicketHub** – A scalable event ticketing system handling concurrency, payments, and inventory consistency  
- **PaySwift** – A production-grade payment gateway with webhooks and Dockerized deployment  
- **Gestura** – An AI-powered real-time sign language translator (patent filed)  
- **VoteChain** – A blockchain-based e-voting platform ensuring transparency and auditability  
- **WebClonePro** – An AI-powered website cloning tool handling dynamic JavaScript content  

These projects forced me to think about:
- Race conditions  
- API design  
- Latency vs accuracy trade-offs  
- Security and reliability  
- Deployment and monitoring  

No tutorial teaches that better than **things breaking at 2 AM**.

## Beyond Code: Communities & Exposure

Alongside building, I actively sought **global exposure and mentorship**:

- 🎓 **Harvard WECode Scholar ’25**  
- 🌏 **HPAIR Asia Delegate ’25 (Tokyo)**  
- 🧠 **Google Launchpad Mentee ’25**  
- ☁️ **Microsoft Code Without Barriers Mentee ’25**  
- 🏆 **Flipkart GRID 7.0 National Semi-Finalist**  
- 💼 **Infosys Springboard Intern & Bluestock SDE Intern**  

These experiences taught me how real engineers think — about impact, scale, and responsibility.

## What This Blog Will Be About

This is not a tutorial dump.

Here, I’ll write about:
- 🛠️ **System design decisions** behind my projects  
- 🤖 **AI & ML learnings** from real deployments  
- 🔐 **Backend & security lessons**  
- 🌐 **Web3 experiments and failures**  
- 🎓 **Student → Engineer transition insights**

If something I build fails, I’ll write about it.
If something works, I’ll explain *why*.

## Closing Thoughts

I’m still learning — and that’s the point.

This blog is my way of documenting growth, sharing insights, and hopefully helping other students who want to go beyond “college-level projects” and build **real software**.

If you’re reading this and building something ambitious —  
you’re already ahead of where you think you are 🚀
